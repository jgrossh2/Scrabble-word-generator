# Tally Max Word Generator

## DESCRIPTION
This application is an educational tool geared toward Scrabble-players and language enthusiasts. This application can be used by dragging and dropping letters into a box and choosing whether to generate a 2 or 3 letter word. The user is then presented with a list of generated words, each clickable in order to view the definition of that word. Along with the definition, the user is given the options of having an audio file play with the word, and/or to view images related to the generated word. There is also a "random" word button which will give the user a random word with emphasis on words beginning with higher point letters. This application uses APIs from Merriam Webster, Pexels, and Pixabay.
